# Insurance-Claims

Project: Insurance Claims Analysis Using Python

Description: Analyzed insurance claims data to identify patterns, reduce fraudulent claims, and optimize customer engagement strategies.

Data Sources:

cust_demographics.csv: Contains customer demographic information such as age, gender, location, and policy details.
claims.csv: Includes details of each insurance claim, including claim amount, date, claim type, and status (approved, rejected, or pending).
Key Steps and Techniques:

Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Handled missing values, standardized categorical variables, and removed duplicate records.
Merged cust_demographics and claims datasets to enable comprehensive analysis of customer profiles and claim behaviors.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed distribution patterns for claim amounts, claim frequencies, and customer demographics.
Performed segmentation analysis to identify high-risk customer groups based on claim frequency and average claim amount.
Fraud Detection Analysis:

Used statistical techniques and visualizations to detect outliers in claim amounts and identify potential fraudulent claims.
Developed fraud detection metrics, such as unusually high claim amounts relative to customer age or location.
Customer Behavior Insights:

Assessed customer loyalty and retention by examining repeat claim patterns.
Identified key demographic factors associated with high claim rates and claim approval rates.
Outcome and Business Impact:

Provided actionable insights for optimizing the claims review process, reducing fraud risk, and improving targeted customer communications.
Recommended strategies to improve claim approval efficiency and enhance customer satisfaction.
Tools and Techniques Used: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Data Merging, Statistical Analysis, Outlier Detection, and Visualization.
